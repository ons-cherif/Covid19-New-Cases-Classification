*TODO:* Write a short introduction to your project.

## Project Set Up and Installation
Being familiar with Microsoft Azure and how it works, it was pretty simple to run this project.<br>

We need just to install required libraries already been gathered within the requirements.txt file under the starter_file directory. I used the microsoft Azure ML Studio embedded Terminal to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and install the desired packages. <br>

But, if this were our first project using Microsoft Azure, we just need to follow the below steps:<br>

### Create a Microsoft Azure account
### Setup a Workspace:

As defined by the official documentation of Microsoft: 
> A Workspace is a fundamental resource for machine learning in Azure Machine Learning. You use a workspace to experiment, train, and deploy machine learning models. Each workspace is tied to an Azure subscription and resource group, and has an associated SKU.
> -- <cite>[Microsoft Azure Worksapce ][1]</cite>



## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
