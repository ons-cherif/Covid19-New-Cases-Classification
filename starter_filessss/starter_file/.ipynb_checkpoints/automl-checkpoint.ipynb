    "* `experiment_timeout_hours = 1.0` : Maximum amount of time in hours that all iterations combined can take before the experiment terminates.\n",
    "* `max_concurrent_iterations = 4` : To help manage child runs and when they can be performed, we match the number of maximum concurrent iterations of our experiment to the number of nodes in the cluster. So, we get a dedicated cluster per experiment.\n",

    "* `featurization= 'auto'` : This indicates that as part of preprocessing, data guardrails and featurization steps are performed automatically.\n",
